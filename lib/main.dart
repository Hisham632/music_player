make a bottom bar to play and pause and that it saves which song we're on
  In the appBar add a leading thing
  Look at discord for model picture

    do th avg background color where based on those 4 it switches
    add a like button
    previous and next button and fix play button
    make the background color the avg color of the pic

































avg color Code
 decoration: BoxDecoration(
            gradient: LinearGradient(
                colors: [Color(0xFFe63946), Colors.black.withOpacity(0.6)],
                stops: [0.0, 0.4],
                begin: Alignment.topLeft,
                end: Alignment.bottomRight,
                tileMode: TileMode.repeated)),




For Miniplayer implementation :
  Make the Stack with AudioPlayer()
  add the state and riverpod
  make it so when we drag the miniplayer above a certain height it goes to the AudioPlayer page
  The Miniplayer has the pause, next and previous buttons and the details of the song playing
